# UltraFlow

Enhanced agentic skills framework for coding agents. Better brainstorming, smarter decisions, adversarial testing, TDD-enforced debugging with post-mortem journals — in ~55% fewer tokens than alternatives.

## What's Different

| Feature | Traditional | UltraFlow |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| Requirements gathering | Linear Q&A | **Progressive Discovery** — staged funnel with option cards. Users find their own requirements. |
| Decision making | Single perspective | **Multi-Agent Council** — 5 persona-driven agents propose diverse solutions, synthesize top 5 options |
| Testing | Unit + integration | **Adversarial Testing** — breaker agents actively try to hack/break your code |
| Token usage | ~12,000-18,000 per workflow | **~5,500-8,000** per workflow (~55% savings) |
| Skill count | 13 separate skills | **10 merged skills** (less overhead, fewer context switches) |

## Skills

1. **discovery** — Progressive requirement discovery in 5 stages: domain scan, option cards, deep dive, spec preview, confidence check
2. **council** — 10 personas (Pragmatist, Architect, Hacker, Researcher, Minimalist, Futurist, Guardian, Optimizer, User Advocate, Integrator). Selects 5 per problem, synthesizes top 5 approaches
3. **planning** — Streamlined plans with code intent (not full blocks), self-review via subagent
4. **building** — Unified TDD + execution + inline code review. Test-first discipline enforced
5. **debugging** — 5-phase systematic approach: observe, hypothesize, test, TDD fix loop, debug journal. Session-scoped (max 3 bugs, one at a time), TDD-enforced (write failing test → confirm red → fix → confirm green → regression check), proof-of-fix gated (no "should fix it" — show actual output), with mandatory post-mortem journals saved to `docs/ultraflow/debug-journals/`
6. **adversarial-testing** — 5 breaker personas (Chaos Monkey, Pentester, Load Tester, Compatibility Checker, Regression Hunter). Fix-and-rebreak cycles
7. **verification** — Evidence before assertions. Fresh command execution required before any success claim
8. **git-flow** — Worktree creation + branch finishing in one skill
9. **parallel-dispatch** — Focused parallel agent dispatch with conflict detection
10. **using-ultraflow** — Bootstrap and skill router

## Installation

### Claude Code (Recommended)

```bash
# Install as a plugin from GitHub
claude install-plugin github:ultraflow/ultraflow
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ultraflow/ultraflow.git

# Navigate to it
cd ultraflow

# Install as Claude Code plugin (from the repo directory)
claude plugin add .
```

### Alternative: Copy to Skills Directory

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/ultraflow/ultraflow.git

# Copy skills to your Claude Code skills directory
cp -r ultraflow/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/

# Copy hooks
cp ultraflow/hooks/hooks.json ~/.claude/hooks.json
cp ultraflow/hooks/session-start ~/.claude/hooks/session-start
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/session-start
```

### Verify Installation

Start a new Claude Code session. You should see UltraFlow's bootstrap message. Try:

```
/discovery    # Start progressive requirement discovery
/council      # Launch multi-agent council for decisions
/building     # Begin TDD implementation
```

## Token Efficiency

UltraFlow is designed for **minimum token consumption**:

- **10 skills** instead of 13 (merged overlapping concerns)
- **<200 lines** per SKILL.md (vs <500 in alternatives)
- **Lazy-loaded** supporting files (personas, breaker definitions only loaded when needed)
- **Code intent** in plans, not full code blocks (~50% savings)
- **Compressed subagent prompts** (<50 lines each, explicit word limits on responses)
- **Token budget metadata** in each skill so the agent can make cost-aware decisions

Full workflow: **~5,500-8,000 tokens** for skill content.

See `docs/token-budget.md` for detailed breakdown.

|--------|------------|-----------|
| Brainstorming | Linear Q&A, one question at a time | 5-stage progressive discovery with option cards |
| Decision making | Single approach | Council of 5 personas → top 5 options |
| Debugging | "Try this fix" loops | Session-scoped TDD fix loop + proof gates + debug journals |
| Regression testing | Manual test suite runs | Adversarial breaker agents with fix-rebreak cycles |
| TDD | Separate skill (extra load) | Embedded in building skill |
| Code review | Separate skill (extra load) | Inline in building skill |
| Git worktrees + finishing | 2 separate skills | 1 merged git-flow skill |
| Token cost | ~12K-18K per workflow | ~5.5K-8K per workflow |
| Skill count | 13 | 10 |
